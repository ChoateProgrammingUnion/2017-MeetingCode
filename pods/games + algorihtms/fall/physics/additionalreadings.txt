Here are some additional readings if you're interested.
Physics engines:
- http://buildnewgames.com/gamephysics/
	- pay close attention to the phrase "integration"/"integrator"
- http://box2d.org/
	- box2d has been implemented in pretty much every language
	- look at it if you're more interested in using proven engines

Vector fields: 
- http://mathinsight.org/vector_field_overview
- Wikipedia
	- Google anything if you're confused, or ask me.
- Pay close attention to the following vector fields:
	- f(x,y) = (y, -x)/(x^2+y^2)
		- AKA typical path-dependent irrotational vector field
		- see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field#Irrotational_vector_fields
	- f(x,y) = (x, y)/(||(x, y)||^3)
		- AKA the gravitational vector field



And, since I'm a total sellout, you can poke around at my code on http://alanluo.com
